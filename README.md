## The Shoppies: Movie Awards for Entrepreneurs 
This application is a webpage that allows a user to  search for and save their favorite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees, they're notified they're finished.

## Motivation
This application was created as a technical assessment for the Shopify Web Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2021 application. In addition to being a requirement for the application, I created the project as an opportunity to help with my Front End development skills and host a live site.
